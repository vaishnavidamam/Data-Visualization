Task 2: Data Visualization, Dashboard & Storytelling

Today, I completed Task 2 of the Data Analyst Internship Program. This task focused on developing effective data visualizations, creating a dashboard, and applying storytelling techniques to communicate data-driven insights.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective
The aim was to present insights from data in a way that is clear, visually appealing, and meaningful for business decision-making.

ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Tableau: Utilized to create interactive and dynamic visualizations, and to design a dashboard that summarizes key insights.
- Alternatively, Power BI could also be used to achieve similar results.

ðŸ“Š What I Did
- Created visualizations that clearly represent key data trends and patterns, such as:
    - Bar charts to compare categorical data
    - Line charts to show time series trends
    - Maps to display geographic data
- Designed a dashboard to summarize multiple insights in an organized, user-friendly format
- Applied storytelling to guide the viewer through the most important findings
- Avoided clutter by keeping visual elements simple and focused
- Minimized overuse of color, using consistent and purposeful color schemes to enhance clarity
- Added appropriate labels, titles, and context for better understanding
